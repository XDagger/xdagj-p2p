# XDAGJ-P2P Development Roadmap

## Version 0.1.2 (Current Release) - Completed Q4 2024

### High Priority ✅ Completed
- [x] **Test Coverage Improvements** ✅ Achieved 75% coverage
  - [x] Added comprehensive message factory tests (MessageFactoryTest with 20 tests)
  - [x] Added handshake message validation tests (HandshakeMessagesTest with 16 tests)
  - [x] Improved channel, handler, and message module tests
  - [x] Achievement: Increased coverage from 66% to 75% (503 tests total)
  - [x] Notable: message.discover (97%), message (93%), message.node (92%)

- [x] **Reputation System Enhancement** ✅ Completed in v0.1.2
  - [x] Add reputation persistence (save/load from disk)
  - [x] Implement reputation decay over time
  - [ ] Add reputation boost for long-lived connections
  - [ ] Configurable reputation thresholds

- [x] **Ban System Enhancement** ✅ Completed in v0.1.2 (Simplified)
  - [x] Implement graduated ban durations
  - [x] Add whitelist for trusted nodes
  - Note: Simplified to duration-based system (removed BanReason enum following extreme simplicity principles)

- [x] **Documentation** ✅ Completed in v0.1.2
  - [x] Added comprehensive REPUTATION.md documentation
  - [x] Updated all documentation to v0.1.2
  - [x] Updated test counts and coverage metrics (491 → 503 tests, 66% → 75% coverage)
  - [x] Updated README.md and PERFORMANCE.md with latest data

### Medium Priority
- [x] **Metrics & Monitoring** ✅ Completed in v0.1.2 (Simplified)
  - [x] LayeredStats for network and application layer metrics
  - Note: Prometheus metrics removed following extreme simplicity principles (zero external dependencies)
